Michael started on the creation of the second level, which aims to introduce new obstacles.

Benny worked on the "boss" mechanics, changing how the boss border pushes the player. Also created new art assets such as a Pile of Paper, a Pencil, and Thumbtacks.

John created new obstacles (eraser platform and thumbtack obstacles), the eraser platform essentially being a bouncy platform for the player to jump off of the reach heights and the thumbtack obstacle acting as spikes for the player to avoid.

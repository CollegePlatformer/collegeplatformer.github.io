Michael tweaked the jumping mechanic, making it less floaty compared to the intial version of the script. Also removed ability to double jump, planning to add back in later stages of the game.

Benny improved the health display so it sticks to the bottom right of the screen regardless of the resolution and started working on the laser obstacle. 

John combined free assets (student model, basic animations) and linked them with Michael's movement script to make the player's character.

Michael finalized implementation on variable jump height/fast-fall, finished layout of level 3, implemented coffee powerup for level 3.

Benny checked on the audio for all sounds and made sure they were reasonable level, added a dash onto the player for movement, added more effects to the pusher to where he gets angrier when you reach halfway and a speedboost, added a small stun effect when the pusher gets hit by a pencil projectile thrown at it.

John made the collapsing book obstacle, made the title sequence, implemented post-processing, fixed lack of NPCs in levels 1 and 3, added floating objects in the background to induce dream-like state.

Michael started working on jump height/fast-fall implementation, tweaked player controller while trying possible implementations.

Benny finalized the bosshead art asset, added a small script that helps the head follow the player.

John implemented spot lighting instead of using directional light, created a school enclosure so default Unity background is not visible by player, adjusted the student NPCs to follow a stricter path and increased population, adjusted paper obstacles to go back and forth on platforms similar to common enemies in other platformers.

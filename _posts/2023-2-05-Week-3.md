Made a trello board, presented our initial idea and received the following feedback: 

> Feedback 
> 
> Make the professor a possible female 
> Make it customizable between different characters?
> Make the final boss customizable?
> Floating students shoots projectile stationeries
> Laser pointers
> Platforms that either trip enemies, projectiles you canâ€™t touch. Play around with the what the projectiles can do
> Other projectiles 
> If the person makes it to the goal, he is fully energized. Else, He either wakes up early and doesn't have enough energy or wakes up late

> Spawn a simple question and make the user ask the right question.
> Fire the answers using the pencil

Looked at similar games for inspiration such as Mario, Mega Man, and Cuphead. Made a GitHub organization and repository for the game.

Went over tasks and assigned to each member.

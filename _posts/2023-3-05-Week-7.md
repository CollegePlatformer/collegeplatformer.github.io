Michael started the creating of the actual level, using primative gameobjects as placeholders for assets that will be made in the near future, focusing mainly on platform placement. Also messed around with camera manipulation.

Benny fixed the laser to where it only follows the X axis instead of the Y axis and started working on the "boss", which is simply a barrier for now.
* Added a border that damages the player and also pushes the player forward if hit
* A groundborder that does the same
* A finish which tells the player that beats the game and a button to try again (Broken at the moment)
* Music that plays when the pusher starts
* A gameover if it reaches 0 lives with a button to try again (Same thing broken)
* Escape key to restart game
* Sound effects when you finish the game and get a gameover


John worked on the game setting, creating a background for the level consisting of classrooms, lockers, and AI-controlled students using NavMesh.
